## Overview
# Project Title: Ticket Classification System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Ticket Classification System project! This project aims to develop a robust machine learning-based classifier for efficiently categorizing support tickets based on their content. The system is designed to handle bilingual data (Arabic and English) and utilizes advanced techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations receive numerous support requests daily. Efficiently categorizing these requests into predefined labels—such as "Technical Issue," "Service Request," and "General Inquiry"—is crucial for improving response times and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, including deep learning and transformer models, to automate the classification process.

### Key Features:
- **Bilingual Support**: Capable of processing and classifying tickets in both Arabic and English.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive methods for cleaning and preparing data for model training.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Implementation of stacking classifiers and deep learning approaches to improve accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Rigorous evaluation methods to ensure model reliability and performance.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository. It includes detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
